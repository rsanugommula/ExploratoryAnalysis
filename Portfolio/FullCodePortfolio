###Title: Code Portfolio ###
Objective: The objective of this task is to get hands on experience with R language.This code library will heplp remind what we have learned throughout the semester
at any point of time in the carrier. It is a great practice to orginize the code and refer in the future whenever needed. Also, it helps to 
quick peek into what are the topics we have learned.This code portfolio will have the four different files organized to show the key topics 
were practiced when a dataset is given. These four topics in exploratory analysis is vital to derive a business value out of a data set.Following these
four steps would give an understanding of the data that we are about to explore and visualize to make effective decisions that could impact the
world stepping towards innovation.

1. Data Import 
Data import will have the code related to the steps that we take to import the datasets.
2. Data wrangling:
Is the step we perform before we do detailed analysis and then a visual speaking the words.in other terms preparing the data.
3. Data Analysis:
It is vital step where the visualizations should be wisely chosen based on the analysis that we do. Data should be properly understandable. 
accuaratley interpreated, and choose the correct visualizations.
4. Data Visualization
a final  step where a business decision could be made. visualization is important and is depedend on both wragling and analysis tasks that we 
do prior to visulization.
