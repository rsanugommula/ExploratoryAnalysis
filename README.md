## Exploratory Analysis Git Hub Project
## Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to get an hands expereience using Git Hub for managing the Codes used in our semesters and also in our daily duties out of the academic practices. Example: Can be leveraged and used at work for managing the version control codes and effectively share and get similar ideas or enhancements to our codes across the board. Especially, the main benifit that student get out of this assignment is, how should the code library be created, maintained and share appropriately with stakeholders and effectively colloborate across the orginization.

## Goals: 

As i stated in the above section, the main goal is to give students an hands on experince using this robhust tool for storing thier codes and share with professor and with other mates working on similar areas. 
1. Oragnize your code library
2. share your ideas with your friends by sharing your code 
3. Be attentive to the other ideas from friends by accessing their codes. How others are thinking about the same concept ( colloboration)
4. Version control


## Data Set Description
The data set has 97 observations and 35 variables. This data is explains about the different bike vendors, models and prices of the bikes for each vendor.The intresting finding after a quick peek into the dataset that we can extract the states from each variables and see what state has more speed cycles by different categories. There is a lot scope for in depth analysis since there are factor and numeric variables. Different models vs speed could give us what model has more speed hence the price is higher. And a correlation between the state and prices of the cycles compare to other state prices with similar models etc. we can certainly analyze various numbers using this dataset and provide a deep insights in our final assignment. A quick peek into the data set has provided in the below section.
