### Purpose of the Github Project:The purpose of this project is to get an hands expereience using Git Hub for managing the Codes used in our semesters and also in our daily duties out of the academic practices. Example: Can be leveraged and used at work for managing the version control codes and effectively share and get similar ideas or enhancements to our codes across the board. Especially, the main benifit that student get out of this assignment is, how should the code library be created, maintained and share appropriately with stakeholders and effectively colloborate across the orginization.

### Goals of the Git Hub Project:
As i stated in the above section, the main goal is to give students an hands on experince using this robhust tool for storing thier codes and share with professor and with other mates working on similar areas. 
# Oragnize your code library
#share your ideas with your friends by sharing your code 
#Be attentive to the other ideas from friends by accessing their codes. How others are thinking about the same concept ( colloboration)
# Version control
# Avoid coding multiple times. It is useful to refer anytime in the future and get our knowledge back
